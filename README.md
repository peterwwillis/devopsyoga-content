## What is this?
This repo contains the content of the [devops.yoga](https://devops.yoga/) Wiki, a community source of knowledge, guidance, and documentation on everything DevOps.

## Where is the content?
The content is currently kept in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/peterwwillis/devopsyoga-content/tree/gh-pages) to be auto-deployed to GitHub Pages. As such, this branch [master] will probably remain empty, so if you only follow this branch, you won't see any activity.
