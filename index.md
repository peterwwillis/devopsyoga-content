## Overview
If you search for "What is DevOps?", you will find hundreds of pages that try to explain the concept, though there is [broad acceptance of what DevOps means](https://devops.com/surprise-broad-agreement-on-the-definition-of-devops/).

In short: the goal of DevOps is to speed up delivery, improve operation, and increase the quality of a software product for a business. The way this is achieved is through methods, tools, and culture, in a way that is continuously improved.

But DevOps is about more than just software. As you learn more about DevOps, you'll find it spills into non-technical aspects of a business. This is because DevOps is really an amalgamation of principles and methods for improving a product or customer experience while keeping quality high. So DevOps can actually be applied throughout an organization, in virtually any industry.

If you come from an Agile or Lean background, another way to think of DevOps is like Agile/Lean methods applied throughout an organization, with the exception that you don't need Agile or Lean to do DevOps.

Also, you should realize that DevOps is a big undertaking not because the tools or processes are complicated. The biggest challenge is in changing everyone's mindset to become comfortable with new ways to work together. DevOps requires breaking down the barriers of traditional siloed teams in an organization, which is often a huge change to existing organizations.
