## Overview
If you search for "What is DevOps?", you will find hundreds of pages that try to explain the concept. However, there is [broad acceptance of what DevOps means throughout the industry](https://devops.com/surprise-broad-agreement-on-the-definition-of-devops/).

The goal of DevOps is to improve the quality of software while speeding up its delivery and operation. The way this is achieved is through a specific culture, a set of processes and tools, working closely with other teams, and constantly working to review and improve all of these aspects to reduce waste and increase quality, and thus business value.

Another way to think of DevOps is as agile methods, applied throughout an organization, to help a software product succeed.

Implementing DevOps is a big undertaking, but not because the tools or processes are complicated. The biggest challenge is in changing everyone's mindset in order to become comfortable with new ways to work together.[citation needed]
