# Deployment

# Undeployment

The process of deployment can include building infrastructure, copying files, changing security rules, and opening network paths for application traffic. If these changes are not removed when they no longer become necessary, various problems emerge. Wasteful use of resources, security vulnerabilities, and overall confusion over legacy configurations can result.

Undeployment processes effectively reverse the deployment process. As a practical tool, they can be one part of a rollback procedure, and as another, help shut down resources no longer in use. They are also useful to reduce waste.
