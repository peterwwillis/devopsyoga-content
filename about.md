### What is this website about?
   This website is a free-form Wiki of all general knowledge involved in implementing [DevOps].

### Why did you create it?
   Basically, I was sick of all the time and effort needed to learn about DevOps. Most of the information about it is spread out through random blog posts on the internet and a few books, and it can take a long time to collate, intone, and spread this information.

   I wanted a place I could go that just had everything I needed to learn about DevOps as it evolves. Nothing like that seemed to exist, so I created this space to collect it all. My hope is that other people will help update this website over time, to prevent the information from getting stale.

### So, what's that going to look like?
   Explanation of the core ideas, models for how to implement DevOps, how-to guides, overviews of technology, lessons learned from real organizations doing DevOps, links to articles and blog posts, sample code, etc.

### Isn't that kind of a big goal?
   Yep! This will be a long-term project, and will require collaboration by many volunteers.

### Is this website commercially supported?
   Nope! The project is intended to be completely free and community-driven. No monetization schemes, no "premium" documentation or guides. Just free information, created by people that use it.

### So the content is free?
   Yes. Everything is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0, unless otherwise specified.

### This doesn't look like a wiki...
   Yep, right now it's just powered by GitHub repo and pages. If we need real Wiki software we can adopt it, but for now we're going with the bare minimum requirements.

### How can I contribute?
   Fork us on GitHub and send us a pull request! Pretty much all content will be accepted, assuming it can be licensed properly. If you don't want to use GitHub, send us a patch.

### Why is the site called DevOps.*yoga*?

Mostly it was just a short domain name, but DevOps does have things in common with [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga).

Both their principles describe a kind of culture based on a set of values and goals. They have different definitions depending on whom you ask, and are often misunderstood through pop culture. They are both misunderstood in pop culture as a reduction of one facet of their ideas. And they are both require a unique journey. They may be more different than alike, but they both seek enrichment, improvement, and enlightenment, through a multifaceted practice.
