# Values & Principles

DevOps and Agile have [things in common, and differences][2]. DevOps evolved while Agile was already being widely practiced (and as a result was actually called "Agile Infrastructure" originally). Because of this, it inheritied many of its principles:

 * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
 * Working software over comprehensive documentation
 * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
 * Responding to change over following a plan
 * Iterative, Incremental, Continuous changes
 * Automated, Self-service tools and services
 * Holistic solutions to problems

But DevOps is less focused on software development, and more focused on software delivery, so it adds a few more general principles, such as:

 * Deep, constant communication between software development and IT operational groups
 * Automated deployment processes
 * Constant feedback on the health of running software/products

You can think of DevOps as widening Agile principles to encompass the systems and operations needed to maintain reliable, quality products for customers at scale.
