# Values & Principles
Here are some of the values & principles of DevOps.

## Inherited from Agile

DevOps and Agile have [things in common, and differences][2]. DevOps evolved while Agile was already being widely practiced (and as a result was actually called "Agile Infrastructure" originally). Because of this, it inheritied many of Agile's principles:

 * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
 * Working software over comprehensive documentation
 * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
 * Responding to change over following a plan
 * Iterative, Incremental, Continuous changes
 * Automated, Self-service tools and services
 * Holistic solutions to problems

You can think of DevOps as widening Agile principles to encompass the systems and operations needed to maintain reliable, quality products for customers at scale.

## Valuing Cross-team Collaboration

DevOps isn't just focused on software. Many of the principles of DevOps come from a perspective of having multiple teams learn from and providing feedback to one another. Some of these principles include the following:

 * Deep, constant communication between software development and IT operational groups
 * Automated deployment processes
 * Constant feedback on the health of running software/products

Not only should Operations be getting constant feedback of the health of the products, but this feedback should go directly back into the development of the product. By informing development of how the product is working, it can help improve the quality of the product, and surfaces problems before they become an issue later on.

## CALMS

As a way to codify some of the central focus of DevOps in a typical organization, Damon Edwards, John Willis and Jez Humble came up with an acronym [CALMS][3]:

 * Culture
   * Focus on people
   * Embrace change and experimentation
 * Automation
   * Continuous delivery
   * Infrastructure as code
 * Lean
   * Focus on producing value for the end user
   * Small batch sizes
 * Measurement
   * Measure everything
   * Show the improvement
 * Sharing
   * Open information sharing
   * Collaboration and communication

DevOps also inherits principles from [Lean manufacturing], such as the [Toyota Kata system].
