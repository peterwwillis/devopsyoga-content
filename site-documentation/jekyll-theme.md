The jekyll theme originally used was "architect".

To improve the user interface, I've imported the theme's main files and modified them a bunch. So there's no longer a theme listed in the \_config.yml file.

The main CSS file is here: \_sass/jekyll-theme-architect.scss

More CSS can be found here: assets/css/

The main layout file is here: \_layouts/default.html
