# Site Documentation

This site is designed with the following in mind:

 - Collaboratively edited and maintained

   As with all Wikis, this site should be written and maintained by volunteers, for the purposes of documenting information they may need or want to share.

 - Wiki-like, but with pull request-based changes.

   The layout of the site should mirror that of a Wiki, but changes are submitted as pull requests, rather than edited directly.

 - Hosted on Github Pages

   The hosting provider may change in the future.

 - Featured Blogs

   At first there will be a site-wide blog, but user blogs should also be supported in the future. The purpose is mainly for editorial or otherwise lengthy explanations of a topic that are not appropriate for Wiki content. Also, news about the Wiki.

 - Uses Jekyll to manage content

   Reliance on Liquid template language, to interface better with Jekyll.
