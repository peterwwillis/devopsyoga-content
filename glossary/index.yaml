      project managers or even clients to directly control deployments.
  - term: Snapshot
    desc: Amazon EBS snapshot is a tool for creating a static copy of your EC2 instance
      content for the purposes of backup and restoration.
  - term: Source Control
    desc: A system for storing, tracking, and managing changes to software. This is
      commonly done through a process of creating branches (copies for safely creating
      new features) off of the stable master version of the software and then merging
      stable feature branches back into the master version. This is also known as
      version control or revision control.
  - term: Staging Environment
    desc: Used to test the newer version of your software before its moved to live
      production. Staging is meant to replicate as much of your live production environment
      as possible, giving you the best chance to catch any bugs before you release
      your software.
- letter: T
  entries:
  - term: Technical Debt
    desc: A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises
      when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying
      the best overall solution.
  - term: Terraform
    desc: automates
  - term: Test Automation
    desc: The use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to
      control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted
      outcomes.
  - term: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    desc: A development practice in which small tests to verify the behavior of a
      piece of code are written before the code itself. The tests initially fail,
      and the aim of the developer(s) is then to add code to make them succeed.

  - term: Unit testing
    desc: the basis of CI/CD, unit testing is the practice of testing the app code
      in small chunks against the automated test codebase before building the app,
      to minimize the time needed to discover and fix the bugs, reducing the time
      to market for a product as a result.
  - term: User Acceptance Test
