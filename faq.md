### What is this website about?
   This website is a free-form Wiki of all general knowledge involved in implementing [DevOps].

### What is it for, though?
   Modern software development and operations technology is changing faster than ever. Staying in the loop of what's changing involves a lot of research that crosses multiple specialities. And many of the lessons learned by one organization are being learned over again by others in painful repetition.

   We want to prevent the need to be constantly plugged into the latest trends in DevOps, or having to perform hours, weeks, or months of research to get caught up. The hope is that as this Wiki is constantly updated, the ability to learn more about DevOps will be quicker and easier. One-stop DevOps shopping.

### So, what's that going to look like?

   Explanation of the core ideas, some models for how to implement DevOps, How-to guides, overviews of technology, lessons learned from real organizations doing DevOps, links to articles and blog posts, sample code, etc.

### Isn't that kind of a big goal?
   Yep! This will be a long-term project, and will require collaboration by many volunteers.

### Is this website commercially supported?
   Nope! The project is intended to be completely free and community-driven. No monetization schemes, no "premium" documentation or guides. Just free information, created by people that use it.

### So the content is free?
   Yes. Everything is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0, unless otherwise specified.

### This doesn't look like a wiki...
   Yep, right now it's just powered by GitHub repo and pages. If we need real Wiki software we can adopt it, but for now we're going with the bare minimum requirements.

### How can I contribute?
   Fork us on GitHub and send us a pull request! Pretty much all content will be accepted, assuming it can be licensed properly. If you don't want to use GitHub, send us a patch.
